### Hi there 👋 I'm Mateusz Jendza

I rally like MTB :bike: and spend time in sauna :sunny:, but this is GitHub and should be about programming!

#### 🔭 I’m currently working on:

-   :rocket: [aws-sandbox](https://github.com/mjendza/aws-sandbox) - This is my AWS Serverless stack. Check [decisions-log](https://github.com/mjendza/aws-sandbox#decisions-log)
-   :airplane: [Sample-Azure-Function](https://github.com/mjendza/AzureFunctionSandbox) - This is my sample Azure C# Function

#### 🌱 I’m currently learning:

-   **decoupling** with serverless (AWS) -> Event-Driven Architecture - check my [PR](https://github.com/mjendza/aws-sandbox/pull/22)
-   CDK
